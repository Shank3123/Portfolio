      <h1 class="pt">Maze Solver</h1>
      <h2 class="pt1">Overview:</h2>
      <p class="cnt">The Maze Solver project is a large project that combines the fields of data structures, algorithms
        and web development. Using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end and
        adding back-end functionality, this project offers a comprehensive solution to solve the Maze
        problem. During the development process, the project team demonstrated a thorough
        understanding of the theoretical foundations of the algorithm and the practical aspects of web
        application development.</p>
        <h2 class="pts">TECHNICAL ASPECTS</h2>
      <h2 class="pt1">Data Structures and Algorithms:</h2>
      <p class="cnt">The project uses various data structures and algorithms for
        maze navigation. Implementations ranging from classic algorithms such as deep-first search
        (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) to more sophisticated approaches such as the A* search
        algorithm demonstrate a good understanding of Maze-solving strategies. The choice of
        algorithm appears to be well thought out, striking a balance between efficiency and complexity.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Frontend Development:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">The frontend of the project, built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
            provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Maze. The design is intuitive with clear
            instructions and controls that allow users to access the maze configuration and visualize the
            solution process. Incorporating responsive design principles ensures that apps are accessible
            across multiple devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Background functionality:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Added background functionality adds depth to the project and enables
            features such as saving and loading maze configurations, as well as generating random
            locations for testing. This aspect represents a holistic approach to software development that
            not only addresses the immediate needs of solving the maze, but also the broader requirements
            for data management and user interaction.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Advantages:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Integration of theory and practice: The project seamlessly integrates theoretical concepts of
            data structures and algorithms with practical implementation in web application development.
            This combination of subjects enriches the educational experience and shows the versatility of
            this concept in different fields.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">User-Friendly Interface:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Front-end design prioritizes usability, making it easy for users to interact
            with Maze solutions. Clear instructions and visual feedback improve the overall user experience
            and ensure that even those unfamiliar with maze-solving algorithms can work with the program.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Scalability and Extensibility:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">The project's modular design provides a solid foundation for future
            improvements and expansion. Whether it includes additional maze-solving algorithms or new
            features are introduced, the software architecture can easily accommodate future
            developments.</p>
        <h2 class="pts">AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT</h2>
        <h2 class="pt1">Performance optimization:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Although the current implementation seems to work, there may be
            opportunities to optimize performance, especially when dealing with large or more complex
            objects. Strategies such as algorithm optimization or parallel processing can be explored to
            improve maze solving efficiency.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Improved Visualization:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Although the visualization of the Maze solution is adequate, there is
            room for improvement in terms of aesthetics and interactivity. Adding dynamic animation or
            interactive elements can increase the visual appeal and engagement of an application.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">Documentation and testing:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">Extensive documentation and thorough testing are important
            aspects of any software project. Improving documentation to clarify code structure and
            functionality, as well as conducting rigorous testing procedures, can increase the reliability and
            durability of a maze solver.</p>
        <h2 class="pt1">The results:</h2>
        <p class="cnt">The Maze Solver project is a great effort to bridge the gap between theory and practice in
            computer science. Combining the principles of data structure and algorithms with front-end and
            back-end development, the project provides a compelling example of interdisciplinary
            collaboration. With a strong foundation and scope for further development, the project promises
            growth and innovation in maze solving algorithms and web applications.</p>
